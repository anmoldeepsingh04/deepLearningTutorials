    "## What is Deep Learning?\n",
    "Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that focuses on using artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn patterns from data. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which often require manual feature engineering, deep learning systems automatically discover the most important features directly from raw data. This makes them especially powerful for large and complex datasets such as images, audio, text, and video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by how the human brain processes information, deep learning models use interconnected layers of neurons that transform input data step by step, learning increasingly abstract and meaningful representations. For example, in image recognition, early layers may learn edges and textures, while deeper layers recognize shapes, objects, and scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of deep learning in recent years has been driven by the availability of massive datasets, improved computational power (especially GPUs and TPUs), and advancements in neural network architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. Deep learning now powers many cutting-edge technologies, including self-driving cars, voice assistants, machine translation, medical imaging, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "While deep learning can achieve state-of-the-art performance, it often requires significant computation resources, large amounts of carefully prepared data, and careful tuning. However, its ability to learn directly from raw data and outperform traditional models in many domains has made it a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence."
