    "### PyTorch\n",
    "It is an open-source library used in machine learning. It was developed by Facebook and was released to the public for the first time in 2016. It is imperative which means it runs immediately and the user can check if it is working or not before writing the full code. We can write a part of code and check it in real time, it is built-in python based implementation to provide compatibility as a deep learning platform. It rapidly gained users because of its user-friendly interface, which made the Tensorflow team acquire its popular features in Tensorflow 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TensorFlow\n",
    "Just like PyTorch, it is also an open-source library used in machine learning. It was developed by Google and was released in 2015. Its name itself expresses how you can perform and organize tasks on data. Production and research are the main uses of Tensorflow. Neural networks mostly use Tensorflow to develop machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keras\n",
    "Keras is not a full-fledged framework for deep learning, but rather a wrapper that has TensorFlow, CNTK and theano at its backend. Working with these frameworks was not convenient, that is why Keras was built."
